~/bin
=====

## Guidelines

- This is usually placed *before* `/usr/bin` and similar entries
  in the PATH. 
- Programs should not contain personal information (incl. usernames,
  passwords, etc), so they can be adapted quickly and shared without
  worry.
- Programs should have either help messages or a description here.
- Programs are prefered over aliases and functions.
- External programs should be symlinked in place, and may either
  be installed to the system (e.g. `cfx`), or be cloned externally,
  or as submodules (e.g. `asciiio`), or alternatively, although that is
  not recommended, copied here (e.g. `hub`, `pgol`).
- The following environments (and only these) should be assumed:
  + Python 2 (as `/usr/bin/python2`)
  + Python 3 (as `/usr/bin/python3`)
  + Ruby 2 (as `/usr/bin/env ruby`)
  + Bash
  + Zsh
  + Perl 5
  + *Build essentials* (a C compiler, Autoconf, etc)
- If no authorship is indicated, [FÃ©lix Saparelli](https://passcod.name)
  should be assumed. If no license is indicated,
  [Public Domain](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)
  should [be assumed](https://passcod.name/license.html).
